lyrics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-12-14/lyrics.csv')

studio_album_tracks <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-12-14/studio_album_tracks.csv')

related_artists <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-12-14/related_artists.csv')

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#For each album, calculate mean values for danceability, energy, and valence
studio_album_tracks %>%
  group_by(album_name) %>%
  summarise(
    danceability_mean = mean(danceability),
    energy_mean = mean(energy),
    valence_mean = mean(valence)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Set factor levels of album_name
  mutate(
    album_name = factor(
      album_name, levels = c("Spice", "Spiceworld", "Forever"))) %>%
  arrange(album_name)
```
What do the variables mean?:
