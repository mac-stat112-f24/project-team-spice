Project Proposal Mayumi Morgan, Cody Da, Jack Hou, and Enrico Verit√† Data set: Spice up your Life

We will analyze the data set "Spice up your Life" which contains information regarding the famous music group the Spice Girls. This data set contains information on album release date, energy, liveliness, danceability, and general statistics on various Spice Girl tracks. We chose this set because we are interested in music and this seems fun and interesting topic. We want to analyze lyrics and maybe analyze which band member sings the most, or we could see which song is the best to dance to.

**Overarching research question:**

-   What kind of music did the spice girls make?

    -   Did their music style change over time? If so, how

-   What kind of themes did the Spice Girls sing about?

**Why is it important:**

-   The Spice Girls were a large part of the cultural zeitgeist of the 90s and early 2000s, influencing music, fashion, as well as other artists. Despite their relatively short time as a group, they remain popular is, as shown by their Olympic performance in 2012 at the London Olympic over a decade after their official disbandment. In 2019 the group reunited and embarked on a European tour. The "Spice World" tour became the highest grossing all-female tour from 2000-2020. This begs the question: what makes their music so successfull?
